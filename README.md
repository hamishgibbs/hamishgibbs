### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Student at University College London studying human mobility and infectious disease modelling. You can see more about my research interests [here](https://hamishgibbs.net/).

* Since 2021, I've been a PhD student in the [UCL Department of Geography](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/geography/hamish-gibbs).
* From 2018 to 2021, I was a Research Assistant at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
* At LSHTM, I studied behavioral responses to COVID-19 travel restrictons and helped create the [WHO Public Health and Social Measures dataset](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/phsm).
* In 2018, I recieved my MSc in Geoinformation Technology and Cartography at the University of Glasgow. In my thesis, I used multi-sensor remote sensing data to measure vegetation growth.
* In 2017, I graduated from Syracuse University with a BA in Geography and minors in Spanish and Applied Statistics.
