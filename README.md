### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Student in Geography at UCL studying human mobility, infectious disease modelling, and the limitations of mobile phone location data. 

You can see more about my research interests [here](https://hamishgibbs.net/).

**BIO**

* Since 2021, I've been a PhD student at the [UCL Department of Geography](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/geography/hamish-gibbs).
* Before moving to UCL, I was a Research Assistant at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) from 2018 to 2021.
* At LSHTM, I studied behavioral responses to COVID-19 travel restrictons, helped create the [WHO Public Health and Social Measures dataset](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/phsm), and contributed to many different projects within the [CMMID COVID-19 Working Group](https://cmmid.github.io/groups/ncov-group.html).
* In 2018, I recieved an MSc in Geoinformation Technology and Cartography at the University of Glasgow. In my research, I used multi-sensor remote sensing data to measure vegetation growth.
* In 2017, I graduated from Syracuse University with a BA in Geography and minors in Spanish and Applied Statistics.

On Github, you can find the source code for a number of my publications as well as personal projects I have made. I have so many GitHub contributions because I love using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).
