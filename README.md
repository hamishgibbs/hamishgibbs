### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [SUN Lab](https://socialurban.net) in the Northeastern University Network Science Institute. I study human behavior using large-scale mobility datasets. You can see more about my research interests [here](https://hamishgibbs.net/).

* From 2021 to September 2024, I was a PhD student at the UCL Department of Geography.
* At UCL, my PhD thesis focused on addressing bias and uncertainty in mobility data.
* In 2024, I also worked as a Consultant Software Engineer with [Applied Epi](https://appliedepi.org/).
* From 2018 to 2021, I was a Research Assistant at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
* At LSHTM, I studied behavioral responses to COVID-19 travel restrictions. This led to publications in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18783-0) and [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009162). I also helped create the [WHO Public Health and Social Measures dataset](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/phsm).
* In 2018, I received my MSc in Geoinformation Technology and Cartography at the University of Glasgow. In my thesis, I used multi-sensor remote sensing data to measure vegetation growth.
* In 2017, I graduated from Syracuse University with a BA in Geography and minors in Spanish and Applied Statistics.

On GitHub, you can find the source code supporting my publications, as well as various personal projects. 

Feel free to check out my projects or reach out to collaborate! If you see a problem with something I've written, make an issue and I'll fix it!
